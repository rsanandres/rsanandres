## Hey, I'm Raph

ML infrastructure and AI systems engineer. Currently supporting GPU clusters (H100s) on Kubernetes at a stealth startup. Previously at [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai).

### What I'm working on

**[Atlas AI](https://github.com/rsanandres/hc_ai)** — Clinical intelligence platform for querying patient records with natural language. Multi-agent RAG pipeline (LangGraph), 20+ medical tools, hybrid vector search (pgvector), and real-time streaming. [Live demo](https://hcai.rsanandres.com)

**[Corium](https://github.com/rsanandres/corium)** — Kubernetes operator in Go (Kubebuilder) with custom CRDs for automated workload monitoring, alerting, and a Next.js dashboard

**[JaxStats](https://github.com/rsanandres/jaxstats)** — League of Legends performance analyzer with FastAPI, XGBoost ML scoring, 8-skill GPI breakdown, and Chart.js visualizations

**[Models from Scratch](https://github.com/rsanandres/models-from-scratch)** — MLP, CNN, and transformer self-attention implemented in pure NumPy with forward/backward passes
